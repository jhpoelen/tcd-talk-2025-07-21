## Guiding Questions

 * What is Open Science?
 
 * How does Trinity's Institutional Repository (TARA) facilitate research today?
 
 * What are TARA's goals for 2030, and how to get there? 
 
## What is Open Science?

> "**Open science** is defined as an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make multilingual **scientific knowledge** openly available, accessible and **reusable for everyone**, to **increase scientific collaborations** and sharing of information for the **benefits of science and society**, and to **open the processes of scientific knowledge creation**, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community."^[UNESCO. (2021). UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949.locale=en]
